.SH NAME
config.json \- OPX alarm service configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
This file configures the OPX alarm service.
.PP
It has 2 purposes:
.IP \(bu
to define the LEDs that will be controlled, and their priority ordering; and
.IP \(bu
to define which conditions cause LEDs to be turned on.
.PP
This file is a JSON file, with a top-level object having 2 properties:
.IP \(bu
leds
.IP \(bu
conditions
.SS leds
The value of the leds property is a list of LED names (strings).  The LEDs are listed in increasing order of priority.
.SS conditions
The value of the conditions property is a list of pairs (2-element lists), with the first element of each pair being a regular expression (string), and the second being an LED name (string).  When a condition that matches the regular expression is outstanding, the corresponding LED will be turned on.  LEDs will be turned on in the defined priority order, such that if 2 LEDs map to the same physical LED, the higher priority LED will control the physical LED.
.PP
A schema for this file is included in the source repo opx-alarm.
.PP
By default, the OPX alarm service opx-alm-service will look for the configuration file /etc/opx/alms/config.json.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following is the contents of the configuration file for a DellEMC S6010-ON switch:
